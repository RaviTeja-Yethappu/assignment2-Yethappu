## Binomial Coefficients

>The binomial coefficient (n; k) is the number of ways of picking k unordered outcomes from n possibilities, also known as a combination or combinatorial number. The symbols _nC_k and (n; k) are used to denote a binomial coefficient, and are sometimes read as "n choose k." (n; k) therefore gives the number of k-subsets possible out of a set of n distinct items. For example, The 2-subsets of {1,2,3,4} are the six pairs {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4}, so (4; 2)=6. The number of lattice paths from the origin (0,0) to a point (a,b) is the binomial coefficient (a+b; a) (Hilton and Pedersen 1991).

int C(int n, int k) {
    int res = 1;
    for (int i = n - k + 1; i <= n; ++i)
        res *= i;
    for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i)
        res /= i;
    return res;
}
